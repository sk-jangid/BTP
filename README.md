# Machine Learning and Deep Learning approach forIntrusion detection systems
In this Project, I have reviewed various Network Intrusions and Intrusion types and challenges in detecting these intrusions. In recent times various Machine learning and Deep learning techniques are used in Intrusion detection systems. In Phase 2, i have evaluated some of these techniques using a standardized dataset and concluded the results.
